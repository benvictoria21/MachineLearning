**Features**:

  * no NAs
  
  * `Step`: represents the day when the transaction happened. There is a total of 180 steps, so the data runs for six months. This variable was removed from the dataset.
  * `Customer`: represents the unique ID of the person who initialized the transaction. It is formed by the letter C, followed by a unique sequence of 10 numbers. There is a total of 4,109 unique customers available in the dataset.
  * `Age`: this variable is split in age intervals, starting from 0 to 6 and the letter U which stands for Unknown. Age is Unknown only for transactions that have the gender equal to Enterprise. The coding for the numbers is: 
    * 0: less than 18 years old
    * 1: between 19 and 25 years old
    * 2: between 26 and 35 years old
    * 3: between 36 and 45 years old
    * 4: between 46 and 55 years old
    * 5: between 56 and 65 years old
    * 6: older than 65 years old
  * `Gender`: this variable is coded as F for Female, M for Male, E for Enterprise and U for Unknown. The Unknown group has around 170 customers aged in groups 1, 2 and 3.
  * `Merchant`: this variable represents the unique ID of the party which receives the transaction. Similar to customer ID, the sequence is formed by the letter M, followed by a series of 9 numbers. There is a total of 50 unique merchants in the dataset.
  * `Category`: there are 15 unique categories that label the general type of the transaction: transportation, food, health, wellness and beauty, fashion, bars and restaurant, hyper, sports and toys, tech, home, hotel services, other services, contents, travel, leisure.
  * `Amount`: represents the value of the transaction. There are only 52 values equal to 0 and no negative values.
  * `Fraud`: a flag column coded with 0 if the transaction was clean and with 1 if the transaction was fraudulent.
  * `zipcodeOri` and `zipMerchant`: these two features were removed from the dataset, as they contained a constant value of 28007, which is a postal code in Ansonville, North Carolina, United States. Therefore, the amount will be from now on expressed in us dollars.

**Other transformations**:

  * All Unknown for `Age` will be kept. It appears that only Enterprise gender doesn't have it's age, so the missingness is systematic. The U will be replaced with number 7.
  * All Unknown for `Gender` will be erased. It appears that the age for these people are in 1, 2 and 3 intervals, which each has an average distribution of F = 55%, M = 44%, U = 1%.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Read in the data
data <- read_csv("../input/banksim1/bs140513_032310.csv")


# Preprocessing steps
data <- data %>% 
  # remove columns with 1 constant value
  dplyr::select(-zipcodeOri, -zipMerchant) %>% 
  
  # remove comas
  mutate(customer = gsub("^.|.$", "", customer),
         age = gsub("^.|.$", "", age),
         gender = gsub("^.|.$", "", gender),

# EDA

## Amount

### Amount Distribution
The amount distribution of the transactions in the dataset is extremely skewed to the right, with more than 95% of the transactions having a value between 1 and 100 dollars, but with the rest reaching extremely high values, with the maximum being more than 8,000 dollars.

```{r}
options(repr.plot.width=18, repr.plot.height=7)
     
data %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = amount)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.1, size = 1, color = colors60s[2], fill = colors60s[2]) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 300), ylim = c(0, 0.08)) +
  labs(x = "Amount", y = "Density", title = "Amound Distribution", subtitle = "extreme skewness to right - maximum value 8329") +
  my_theme

# ggsave("amount distribution.jpeg")
```

### Bigger spenders

```{r}
gender <- data %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(avg_spent = mean(amount)) %>% 
  gather("Metric", "Value", 1:1)

age <- data %>% 
  group_by(age) %>% 
  summarise(avg_spent = mean(amount)) %>% 
  gather("Metric", "Value", 1:1)

category <- data %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  summarise(avg_spent = mean(amount)) %>% 
  gather("Metric", "Value", 1:1)

options(repr.plot.width=18, repr.plot.height=7)
     
bind_rows(gender, age, category) %>% 
  mutate(Metric = factor(Metric, levels = c("category", "age", "gender"))) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Value, avg_spent), y = avg_spent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = as.factor(Metric))) +
  facet_wrap(~Metric, scales = "free", labeller = as_labeller(c("category"="Category", "age"="Age", "gender"="Gender"))) +

  coord_flip() +
  geom_label(aes(label = formatC(avg_spent, format="f", big.mark=",", digits=0)), size = 3) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors60s[c(3, 4, 5)], guide = "none") +
  my_theme +
  labs(x = "Value", y = "Average Spent ($)", title = "Biggest Spenders", subtitle = "average expenditure ($)")

#ggsave("biggest spenders.jpeg")
```

### Fraud Percentage for Spent Amount Thresholds
The fraud percentage on different amount thresholds is very interesting as well. There are close to none fraudulent cases throughout transactions between 1 and $500, but above this value, the percentage jumps to 90% or more chance of the transaction being fraud. 

```{r}
options(repr.plot.width=18, repr.plot.height=7)
     
data %>% 
  mutate(amount_thresh = factor(amount_thresh, levels = c("0-500", "500-1000", "1000-1500", "1500-2000",
                                                          "2000-2500", "2500-3000", ">3000"))) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = amount_thresh, fill = as.factor(fraud))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  coord_flip() +
  
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors60s[c(4, 2)]) +
  my_theme +
  labs(x = "Amount Threshold", y = "Percent%", title = "Fraud Percentage for Amount Thresholds", subtitle = "fraud probability increases with the increase of spent amount", fill = "Fraud")

#ggsave("fraud percentage.jpeg")
```

### Amount Distribution - values above and below $250 

```{r}
options(repr.plot.width=18, repr.plot.height=7)
    
data %>% 
  mutate(flag = ifelse(amount <= 250, "below $250", "above $250")) %>% 
  group_by(fraud, flag) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(fraud), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = as.factor(flag)), stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ flag, scales = "free") +
  
  geom_label(aes(label = formatC(n, format="f", big.mark=",", digits=0)), size = 3.2) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors60s[c(2, 3)], guide = "none") +
  my_theme + theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "Is Fraud", y = "Frequency", title = "Fraud above and below $250/transaction", subtitle = "higher fraud probability above $250")

#ggsave("fraud above and below $250.jpeg")
```


### Amount Outliers
There was further investigation made on how these extremely high transactions look: the majority are expenses in the travel, health, sports and toys categories, usually done by people between 18 and 45 years old. Also, there are more transactions made by females than by men between these outliers.

```{r}
gender <- data %>% 
  filter(amount > 500) %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  gather("Metric", "Value", 1:1)

age <- data %>% 
  filter(amount > 500) %>% 
  group_by(age) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  gather("Metric", "Value", 1:1)

category <- data %>% 
  filter(amount > 500) %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  gather("Metric", "Value", 1:1)

options(repr.plot.width=18, repr.plot.height=7)
    
bind_rows(gender, age, category) %>% 
  mutate(Metric = factor(Metric, levels = c("category", "age", "gender"))) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Value, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = as.factor(Metric))) +
  facet_wrap(~Metric, scales = "free", labeller = as_labeller(c("category"="Category", "age"="Age", "gender"="Gender"))) +

  coord_flip() +
  geom_label(aes(label = formatC(n, format="f", big.mark=",", digits=0)), size = 3) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors60s[c(3, 4, 5)], guide = "none") +
  my_theme +
  labs(x = "Value", y = "Frequency", title = "Amount Outliers", subtitle = "how do the highest transactions look?")

#ggsave("outliers amount.jpeg")
```

## Fraud

### Fraud Frequency
The percentage of fraudulent transactions is 1.2%, with only 7,160 available fraud cases compared to the non-fraudulent ones, which are 584,073.

```{r}
options(repr.plot.width=18, repr.plot.height=7)
     
data %>% 
  group_by(fraud) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = as.factor(fraud)), position = "stack") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  #geom_text(aes(y = n/3 + c(0, cumsum(n)[-length(n)]), label = formatC(n, format="f", big.mark=",", digits=0)), size=5) +
  
  geom_label(aes(y = n/2.5 + c(0, cumsum(n)[-length(n)]), label = formatC(n, format="f", big.mark=",", digits=0)), size=3.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors60s[c(2, 5)], guide = "none") +
  my_theme + theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "Fraud Frequency", subtitle = "there are 1.2% fraud cases")

#ggsave("fraud frequency.jpeg")
```

### Gender and Age Fraud Frequency

For both variables `gender` and `age` there is no clear pattern between fraud and non-fraud cases. The distribution frequencies follow a similar pattern, so there can’t be said that one level influences fraud more than another. However, an insight about the demography of the customers can be drawn from these two bar plots: most are aged between 19 and 45 years old, while females hold a bigger percentage of the total transactions than men. 55% of the total transactions are performed by women, while 44% are held by men, and only 1% are made by enterprises.

```{r}
options(repr.plot.width=18, repr.plot.height=7)
    
data %>% 
  group_by(gender, fraud) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(as.factor(gender), n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = as.factor(fraud))) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ fraud, scales = "free", labeller = as_labeller(c("0"="Not Fraud", "1"="Fraud"))) +

  geom_label(aes(label = formatC(n, format="f", big.mark=",", digits=0)), size = 3.2) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors60s[c(4, 2)], guide = "none") +
  my_theme + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Frequency", title = "Fraud Transactions for Gender", subtitle = "most frauds happen to females (1.4%)")

#ggsave("gender fraud.jpeg")
```


```{r}
options(repr.plot.width=18, repr.plot.height=7)
     
data %>% 
  group_by(age, fraud) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(as.factor(age), n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = as.factor(fraud))) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ fraud, scales = "free", labeller = as_labeller(c("0"="Not Fraud", "1"="Fraud"))) +

  geom_label(aes(label = formatC(n, format="f", big.mark=",", digits=0)), size = 3.2) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors60s[c(4, 2)], guide = "none") +
  my_theme + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Frequency", title = "Fraud Transactions for Age", subtitle = "most frauds happen to people between 26 and 45 years old")

#ggsave("fraud transactions in age.jpeg")
```


### Fraud in Spending Categories

Categories also experience a high class-imbalance. There are around 500,000 transactions made alone in the transportation category, while the rest 90,000 transactions split unevenly between the other 14 categories left. 
In absolute value, the categories that have the most fraud cases are in areas like sports and toys, health, wellness and beauty. Going even further and looking at category fraud weight, there can be seen that leisure, travel, sports and toys have more than half of the transactions flagged as fraud, while transportation, food and contents have 100% clean cases.

```{r}
options(repr.plot.width=18, repr.plot.height=7)
     
data %>% 
  filter(category != "transportation") %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(as.factor(category), n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = n)) +
  coord_flip() +
  
  geom_label(aes(label = formatC(n, format="f", big.mark=",", digits=0)), size = 3.2) +

  my_theme + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "Category", y = "Frequency", title = "Category Transaction Frequency", subtitle = "transportation has a little bit above 500,000 transactions")

#ggsave("categories transaction frequency.jpeg")
